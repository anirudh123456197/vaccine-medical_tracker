 THE MAIN GOAL IS TO REDUCING BLACK MARKETING AND HOARDING BY BRINGING IN TRANSPARENCY.
 done by a decentralized system created using a blockchain and its hashing algo SHA 256
this is a work in progress the HTML page and smart contacts needs some work and has to be connected to the script.

The end product that I want to achieve is that :
the producer gives the number of vaccines in and publish their key
every state declares the number of vaccines procured so does each hospital all the data publicly available and the hospitals giving out a database of every patient's hash id. So every vaccine given out will be linked to a hash id and the number of vaccines available is transparent.

In short, the steps are
1] producer gives numbers produced=> hash and data public
2] states gives numbers recieved=> hash and data public
3] hospitals gives numbers recieved=> hash  and data public
4] hospitals gives the  database of hashes of vaccines given to each person => hash public data private.
5] hospital database will show how many vaccines available at that point.
    [ every reduced number of vaccines => generation of a new hash]          hence transparent.
